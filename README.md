# UsefulStuff

This is a library of useful functions for debug and rapid prototyping purposes. This is made on unity 5.5.0b10 but should work for previous versions of unity

# Using the library

You can download Export.unitypackage to include it in your project.

# Exporting the package yourself

Assuming your unity is installed in the default directory, you can run Export.bat to auto export the library. Otherwise, open unity and export all the scripts in the Helper folder.
